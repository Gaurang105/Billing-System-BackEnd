# **Online Billing System - Node.js Server**

This Node.js server is designed to provide a robust solution for businesses looking to streamline their billing operations. With this system, businesses can manage invoicing, payments, and financial transactions effortlessly, all through our API-centric design based on RESTful principles.

The application is built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB Cloud, providing a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience for customers.



## **Features:-**

### 1. **User Account Management:**
- **Registration & Login**: Users can easily register, ensuring their data's security with password hashing. They can then log in to access their accounts.
  
- **Secure Logout**: Users can securely log out, ensuring no residue of their session remains.

- **JWT Authentication**: Leveraging JSON Web Tokens (JWT), we've ensured secure and efficient authentication. The tokens are stored as cookies, guaranteeing protected routes and sessions.

### 2. **Administrative Privileges:**
- **Exclusive Access**: We've incorporated a distinct role for administrators, granting them exclusive rights to oversee and manage the platform's core functionalities.
  
- **Product & Service Management**: Administrators have the liberty to introduce new products and services, enhancing the platform's offerings.

- **Order Oversight**: Administrators have a dedicated dashboard allowing them to review and monitor all customer orders.

### 3. **Shopping Experience:**
- **Dynamic Cart**: Users can actively add products and services to their shopping carts, ensuring they have all they need in one place.
  
- **Cart Flexibility**: The system empowers users with full control over their cart. They can update item quantities, remove specific products or services, or even opt to clear the cart entirely.

- **Checkout & Order Confirmation**: With a straightforward checkout process, users can review their total bill (inclusive of tax breakdowns) and securely confirm their orders.

### 4. **Tax Calculation Utility:**
- **Dedicated Tax-Calculator**: We've segregated the tax computation logic into a distinct module. This ensures taxes are applied individually based on the pricing of products and services, guaranteeing accuracy and clarity.

## **Installation:-**

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
## **Deployment:-**

1. Download the .env file attached in the e-mail and put it inside the root project directory. Or you can create a `.env` file in the root directory itself and then paste this in the `.env` file:
```bash
MY_DB_URL = "mongodb+srv://gujratigaurang:Shanu105@cluster0.1z0q8wj.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
MY_SECRET_KEY = "bcbskjcdkjdnlanslcnksjddbckbcckj"
```

2. Once that's done, you will just have to start the server and it will connect to the MongoDB Cloud Database.

3. Now start the server: `npm start`

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:8001`

NOTE: I've added postman collection in the Postman Collection folder. 

## **API Endpoints:-**

### **1. General:**
- `GET /`: Fetch all items (both products and services) curated and added by the Admin.

### **2. User Management:**
- `POST /users/register`: Register a new user. Required fields include `email`, `password`, and a boolean `isAdmin` property. If the user is already registered, the endpoint will return an error.
  
- `POST /users/login`: Authenticate and log in the user. The system will create a JWT token and store it as a cookie for subsequent sessions and logout purposes. For login, use `email` and `password`.
  
- `GET /users/logout`: Securely log out the user by deleting the JWT token's associated cookie.

### **3. Cart Operations:**
- `GET /carts`: Retrieve the active user's shopping cart.
  
- `POST /carts/product/:productID`: Add a specific product to the cart. You need to send the product's `quantity` in the request body.
  
- `POST /carts/service/:serviceID`: Add a specific service to the cart. Like products, send the service's `quantity` in the request body.
  
- `DELETE /carts/product/:productID`: Remove a specific product from the cart.
  
- `DELETE /carts/service/:serviceID`: Remove a specific service from the cart.
  
- `DELETE /carts`: Completely clear out the user's cart.

- `POST /carts/checkout`: Initiate the checkout process, calculating and presenting the total bill.

- `POST /carts/confirmOrder`: Confirm the cart's contents as a formal order. This order is added to a cumulative list, accessible only by the Admin.

### **4. Order Management (Admin Exclusive):**
- `GET /orders`: Fetch a comprehensive list of all orders made by users. Only accessible by administrators.

### **5. Product & Service Management (Admin Exclusive):**
- `POST /products/add`: Add a new product to the product collection in the database. The request should contain the `product name` and its `price`.

- `POST /services/add`: Similarly, add a new service to the service collection in the database. The request should contain the `service name` and its `price`.
## **Technologies Used:-**

### **Backend Technologies:**
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: Our primary runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side.
  
- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**: Fast, minimal, and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides us with a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**: A NoSQL database where all data, including products, services, and user information, are stored.

- **[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)**: Helps us connect to MongoDB and use schema-based models for structured data.

### **Authentication & Security:**
- **[Bcrypt.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)**: For hashing and securing user passwords before saving them to the database.

- **[Crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html)**: Built-in Node.js module to deal with cryptographic functions.

- **[JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/)**: Ensures secure transmission of information between parties as a JSON object.

### **Utilities:**
- **[Cookie-Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser)**: Middleware to help parse and manage cookies.

- **[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)**: Enables the loading of environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

### **Development & Testing Tools:**
- **[Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)**: Utility that monitors any changes in the source and automatically restarts the server.

- **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)**: Tool I used for testing and documenting our API endpoints.
## **Future Updates:-**

### **1. Enhanced Search Functionality**
- **Product and Service Search**: Enhancing our platform with a robust search functionality, enabling users to quickly and efficiently find specific products or services.

### **2. Comprehensive User Experience**
- **Order History**: For better transparency and to help users track their expenditure, we're introducing an 'Order History' feature, letting users access a detailed record of all their past transactions.

- **User Reviews and Ratings**: Recognizing the power of community-driven feedback, we're gearing up to launch a system where customers can share their reviews and ratings on products and services. This enriches the buying experience for others and provides valuable insights.

- **User Profile Management**: Putting users in control of their personal data, we're enhancing our platform to allow easy and secure modifications to user profiles.
